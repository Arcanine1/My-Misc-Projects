This is my voice modulator
input in a wav file

Will create a file called scrambled.wav which contains your voice modulation. Also plays the Voice modulation

Use the combination of 3 fumctions

modulateSpeed() :  amount = approximate number of slowdowns

addNoise() : adds noise to the signal

Lowpitched: uses a low pass filter/ moving average to reduce high pitched sounds from the voice which 
            are often the most defining characteristcs

Already have 2 practice files there for trial and error if you want to tune your voice modulation however you so choose
